Welcome to my academic homepage! I am an undergraduate student of Nanjing University passionate about Artificial Intelligence.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on **Tabular Data Analysis** and **Code Repair and Software Engineering**, with particular emphasis on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of machine learning workflows. I am particularly interested in:

* **Tabular Data Processing**: Developing novel approaches for handling and analyzing structured data, including feature engineering, data preprocessing, and model optimization for tabular datasets.

* **Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)**: Researching techniques to automate the machine learning pipeline, including hyperparameter optimization, model selection, and feature selection for improved model performance.

* **Code Repair and Software Engineering**: Working on automated code repair systems, particularly in the context of SWEBench agentless approaches, to improve software reliability and development efficiency.

## Education
